\section{Introduction}
This document describes the 16-bit Kogge-Stone adder project in the course TSEK06. The project took the TOP-DOWN approach starting with a rough description of the behaviour of the system and ended up with a full custom design implemented in \SI{0.35}{\micro\m} CMOS technology. The main reason for doing this is to be able to simulate all logic to make sure everything works as intended before moving on to the next stage. A full in-depth description of the project can be found in section \ref{sec:project_description}.
