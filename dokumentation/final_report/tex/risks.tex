\section{Risks} \label{sec:risks}
During the transistor level design there hasn't been any considerable delays. The only thing that is an issue is that all members in the group has quite different schedules which sometimes can hinder cooperation. However the group has solved this by using good tools for project tracking (Trello) and communication (Slack). This has helped considerably with the delegation of tasks and keeping track of what needs to be done. 

During the next phase of the project, cooperation will be more important since the tasks will be harder. We will need to plan ahead and schedule occasions where we all can meet and work together.
