\section{Risks} \label{sec:risks}
Even though the project itself is done, there is still some risks that have to be taken into consideration before the evaluation of the chip.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item There might be some small manufacturing errors that can cause the chip to malfunction.
	\item The evaluation plan might not be extensive enough, so that much time must be wasted to remember exactly how the chip works and should be tested.
	\item Simulations cannot 100\% reflect the reality, so some small deviations might cause to chip to behave in an unwanted manner.
	\item The simulations might not be extensive enough, and some untested indata might produce the wrong result.
\end{enumerate}
