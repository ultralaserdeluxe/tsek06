\section{Introduction}
This document describes the state of the project Kogge-Stone adder ~\cite{projectdescription} in the course TSEK06 after finishing the high level design phase. The meaning of high level is that the every basic logic gate is implemented in VerilogA. The main reson for doing this is to be able to simulate all logic to make sure that everything works as intended. Block level diagrams can be found in section \ref{sec:block_level}, simulation results in section \ref{sec:simulation_results} and a small risk analysis in section \ref{sec:risks}. In appendix \ref{app:time_plan} and \ref{app:time_report} a time plan of the next phase and a time report of this phase can be found.
