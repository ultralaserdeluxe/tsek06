	   {Project plan} & {This is an aid for the project group, describing some basics needed for the collaboration of the project group. This will also include a time plan.} & {2016-01-31} \\\hline
	   {High-level design report} & {It should include the complete block level description of the project. Simulation results that verifies the desired functionality should be included. An updated time plan and a time report should be included as well.} & {2016-02-19} \\\hline
	   {Transistor design report} & {It should include the complete block level description of the project. Simulation results that verifies the desired functionality should also be included. An updated time plan a, a time report, PAD assignments and an early test plan should be included as well. } & {2016-03-18} \\\hline
	   {Final report} & {Block level from the two previous reports should be included along with simulation results of the final design. A final time report, an evaluation plan and a PAD list should also be included. A short evaluation of the project should be included as well.} & {2016-05-27} \\\hline
