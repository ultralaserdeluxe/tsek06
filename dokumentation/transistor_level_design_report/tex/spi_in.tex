\subsection{SPI-in/PRBS}
This module only use basic leaf-cells at the transistor level, so this will be a quite small chapter. There are a few things worth noting regarding the sizing of these basic blocks. Some of the signals are connected to a large amount of devices (60+), which meant that the signal got really weak. This was solved by either just making the gates a bit bigger, or by using a buffer. SPI\_en is using a xx buffer, SPI\_clk is using a xx buffer, clk\_en is using a xx buffer and test\_mode is using a 9x buffer.
