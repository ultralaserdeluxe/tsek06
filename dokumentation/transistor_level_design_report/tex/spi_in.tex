\subsection{SPI-in/PRBS}
This module only use basic leaf-cells at the transistor level, so this will be a quite small chapter. There are a few things worth noting regarding the sizing of these basic blocks. Some of the signals are connected to a large amount of devices (60+), which meant that the signal got really weak. This was solved by either just making the gates a bit bigger, or by using a buffer. SPI\_en is using a 9x buffer, SPI\_clk is using a 27x buffer and test\_mode is using a 9x buffer. Clk\_en is the result from an OR gate, and the NOR gate inside it is 6x bigger and the inverter is 18 times bigger. With these modifications, the rise time of the signal was on a healthy level.
