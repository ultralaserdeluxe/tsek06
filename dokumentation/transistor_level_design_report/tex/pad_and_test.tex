\section{Pad Assignment and Early Test Plan}
The following signals will be connected to external pins on the chip, where the first seven are inputs and the last five are outputs:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Vdd1 - Will provide most of the system with power and will be a steady 3.3 V.
	\item Vdd2 - Will provide the adder with power and it might vary from 3.3 V downto below thresholdvoltage
	\item GND - Ground
	\item Clk - 
	\item SPI\_clk
	\item SPI\_en
	\item SPI\_in
	\item SPI\_out
	\item BIST\_out
	\item Cin
	\item Cout
	\item Sum15
\end{itemize}
