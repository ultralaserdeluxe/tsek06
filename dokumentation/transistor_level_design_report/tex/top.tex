\section{Block Level Description} \label{sec:block_level}
Much of the block level descriptions can be seen in the high level report, but the transistor view of the leaf-cells will be described in this chapter. To find good sizes for our gates we used a very simple sizing strategy. Start small, and if the signal is to weak to drive the components, we just size it up and if necessary, make a buffer for it. The transistor schematic of the basic blocks like AND, OR, DFF etc. are simple enough that we do not include any description of them.
