\section{Introduction}
This document describes the state of the 16-bit Kogge-Stone adder project in the course TSEK06 after finishing the transistor level design phase. The meaning of transistor level is that the every basic logic gate is implemented with CMOS transistors. The main reson for doing this is to be able to simulate all logic to make sure that everything works as intended. Updated block diagrams can be found in section \ref{sec:block_level}, simulation results in section \ref{sec:simulation_results} and a small risk analysis in section \ref{sec:risks}. In appendix \ref{app:time_plan} the time plan for the next phase can be found.
